## Description

Create an application from started codebase called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js to retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

- When opening the Note Taker, the user is presented with a landing page with links to a note page.

- When the user clicks the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.

- When the user enters a new note title and text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

- When the user clicks on the Save icon, then the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

- When an existing note in the list in the left-hand column is clicked, then that note appears in the right-hand column.

- When the user clicks the Write icon in the navigation bar at the top of the page, then they are presented with empty field to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
